##SimpleSSH, by RootPrivacy.com##

Current Version: RELEASE 1.0

Script built for Linux(Ubuntu/Debian) 

A script that makes managing multiple servers easy. 
All you have to do is add your servers via IP, Port, & Password, the information will be saved in seperate files, and you will be able to use the script to easily connect to them. 

I made this script for personal use as I was getting tired of manually entering the IP/Pass every time I wanted to SSH into one of my
billion servers, this script automates it and saves a lot of time. 

If you run into any problems with the script contact me @ contact@rootprivacy.com
